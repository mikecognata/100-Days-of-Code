# Day 2

Today, I worked on ...
- Building a MERN app 
- Pushing my changes to GITh.

## MERN App
Today was about getting into the repetition. I became even more familiar with the whole node/npm/mongo/REST ecosystem today. And by 'familiar' I mean learning thru heaps of errors. I've got my server and React app all set up, but the theme of the day was App - Database communication. That will be wehre I pick up tomorrow. 

Till then !
