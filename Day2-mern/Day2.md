# Day 2

Today, I worked on ...
- Building a MERN app
- Users database
- Pushing my changes to GITh.

## MERN App
Today was about getting into the repetition. I became even more familiar with the whole node/npm/mongo/REST ecosystem today. And by 'familiar' I mean learning thru heaps of errors. I've got my server and React app all set up! Took me a bit of time but a slow pace won the race. I decided to write a step by step guide for myself to solidfy the actions and the reasons behind them. Feeling hella comfortable. Maybe next time i'll work on authentication.

Till then !
